  <h2>Hi!</h2>
  <p>Dan Miller here. I am a student at <a href="http://www.marist.edu">Marist College</a> studying Computer Science and Information Technology. I <a href="/blog">blog</a> infrequently, <a href="http://twitter.com/jazzdan">tweet</a> slightly more, but I hang around on <a href="https://plus.google.com/105380111732815377106/">Google+</a> the most.</p><br/>
  <p>I am currently employed part time at the Marist College IT Department where I develop internal applications, but I am also engaged in some of my own <a href="https://github.com/jazzdan">projects</a>.</p><br/>
  <p>Here's my formal <a href="/danmiller-resume.pdf">resume</a>. Feel free to contact me if you want to chat, <a href ="mailto:dan@danielsmiller.com">email</a>'s usually the best way.</p>
